Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Here's the current best take of the readme for Josh:

> My energy sometimes goes to software, sometimes hardware, according to the principles of [practical object oriented design in ruby](https://www.poodr.com/), [a pattern language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199), and [the high cost of free parking](https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X).

I'd most like to work on the real-world traffic problems, applying ideas banal and common in manufacturing and software, to the road network in Denver. click over to [https://josh.works][https://josh.works] for more on that.

I enjoy lots about the work in/around 'software', though. ([evidence](https://josh.works/tags#programming)/[detritus](https://www.intermediateruby.com/)) :) Ruby/Rails & B2B SaaS has been a major theme of my work, and a current focus is 'make your rails test suite _way_ faster, saving the entire team time and money.' 

Test run time is complicated, all else equal, _I_ prefer tests/builds to "feel fast(er)", but also don't mind horribly when they incrementally get a bit slower. If yours are or have been becoming slower than you really want, lets talk! 

Examples: 20 min test suite to 12:30. 5 minute test suite to 1:20. OpenStreetMap's [96 second suite to 40](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/pull/4708#issuecomment-2068149343), or if your machine is slower, ~8 minutes to ~3.5. _etc_. I like to work on the ðŸš…-sized test suites too. 

Email is in my bio. Happy to snag a virtual â˜•, or ðŸš¶through ðŸ§€ park in Denver: [https://josh.works/coffee](https://josh.works/coffee)
