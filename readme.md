Hi there! 👋

Do you wish you were better at stuff? 

I do. 

In some domains, I find it helpful to write about what I'm trying to do. 

Software is one of those domains. I help others get better at "software stuff", however that's defined.

You should join me.

I _just_ set up a Github sponsors profile:

👉 [github.com/sponsors/josh-works](https://github.com/sponsors/josh-works)

I help my sponsors make meaningful improvements to their lives and/or businesses.

For this, I charge between $1 and $12,000/mo. 

Yes, I am serious, and those are both reasonable figures, depending on... well, _you_, and circumstances about your life.

I [like to grab coffee with people](https://josh.works/coffee). 

If you're in or passing through Golden, Colorado, lets meet up: https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee

If you're _not_ in Golden, lets meet up via Zoom. ☝️ use the above Calendly URL.
