Ahoy! 👋

I'll slowly bring over information to here from:

- [josh.works/about](https://josh.works/about)
- [intermediateruby.com/about](https://intermediateruby.com/about)

I write a lot, and teach a lot.

I _just_ set up a Github sponsors profile:

👉 [github.com/sponsors/josh-works](https://github.com/sponsors/josh-works)

Look over it, give me feedback, consider contributing between $1 and $12,000/month.

(Yes, I am serious, and those are both reasonable figures, depending on... well, _you_, and circumstances about your life. )

I [like to grab coffee with people](https://josh.works/coffee). If you're in Golden, and the weather's warm enough to be outside, let's grab a coffee in person: https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee

If you're _not_ in Golden, lets meet up via Zoom. ☝️ use the above Calendly URL.
