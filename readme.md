Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

In some domains, I find it helpful to write about what I'm trying to do, why I'm doing it, or little notes to myself that were useful, and I probably wish I had before I'd embarked on that thing I did, or might need to reference in the future.

Software is one of those domains, so some of what I do and write about relates to "software", however that's defined, and numerous related domains.

I'm often happy to [grab a coffee](https://josh.works/coffee).

A current-enough project is to [map my own mobility data](https://mobility-data.herokuapp.com/), as gathered via the Strava app/API. 

In my ideal world, I'd bring to life some of the principles contained within [The High Cost of Free Parking](https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X), [Order Without Design](https://www.amazon.com/Order-without-Design-Markets-Cities/dp/0262038765), and [A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199).

Until then, I still work in/on 'the software industry'. B2B SaaS businesses using Ruby and Rails has been the constant thread through much of my work career.
