Hi there! üëã

In some domains, I find it helpful to write about what I'm trying to do, why I'm doing it, or little notes to myself that were useful, and I probably wish I had before I'd embarked on that thing I did, or might need to reference in the future.

Software is one of those domains, so some of what I do and write about relates to "software", however that's defined, and numerous related domains.

For this, I charge somewhere between $0 and $12,000.

Yes, I am serious, and those are both reasonable figures, depending on... well, _you_, and circumstances about your life.

I [like to grab coffee with people](https://josh.works/coffee). 

If you're in or passing through Golden, Colorado, I'm happy to meet up! I climb regularly at the local climbing gyms, and have a 125cc moped that I love to ride all over town, and will definately try to convince you to get one too. https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee.

If you're _not_ in Golden, lets meet up via Zoom. ‚òùÔ∏è use the above Calendly URL.
