Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

In my ideal world, this bio would say:

> Embedded in {team}, I work in {city} to 'garden' very specific places and pathways, generally according to the principles of [A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199), [Order Without Design](https://www.amazon.com/Order-without-Design-Markets-Cities/dp/0262038765), and [The High Cost of Free Parking](https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X).
> 
> This work makes these spaces dramatically safer and more enjoyable to experience, at many different levels.
> 
> Because they're more enjoyable and safer, all involved parties feel like they have a little more time, beauty, and ease in their days. They also have more income, and have reduced their operating expenses.

Until then, I still work in/on 'the software industry'. B2B SaaS businesses using Ruby and Rails has been the constant thread through much of my work career.

A current-enough project is to [map my own mobility data](https://mobility-data.herokuapp.com/). Here's the [underlying github repo](https://github.com/josh-works/polyline-model-with-mark)

The data is interesting, in my opinion.

Email is in my bio. Feel free to say hello.
